# Dashboard Issues to Create on GitHub

## Critical Bugs (Priority: High)

### Issue 1: Infinite Re-render Risk in Dashboard Page
**Title:** [BUG] Dashboard page has infinite re-render risk due to useCallback dependency issues
**Labels:** bug, critical, dashboard, performance
**Description:**
The `loadDashboardData` function in `/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/page.tsx` is recreated on every render despite using `useCallback` with an empty dependency array. This can cause infinite re-renders and memory leaks.

**Location:** `app/(authenticated)/dashboard/page.tsx:89`
**Impact:** High - Can cause browser crashes and poor UX

### Issue 2: Race Condition in Data Loading
**Title:** [BUG] Race conditions in dashboard data loading with incomplete cleanup
**Labels:** bug, critical, dashboard, async
**Description:**
Multiple async operations in dashboard loading without proper cleanup. AbortController signals not consistently checked, leading to potential state updates after component unmount.

**Location:** `app/(authenticated)/dashboard/page.tsx:89-130`
**Impact:** High - Can cause memory leaks and inconsistent state

### Issue 3: Cache Hook Implementation Issues
**Title:** [BUG] useDashboardCache hook has circular dependencies and stale closures
**Labels:** bug, critical, hooks, performance
**Description:**
The `useDashboardCache` hook has circular dependency issues in useEffect and missing dependencies, causing stale closure problems.

**Location:** `hooks/use-dashboard-cache.ts:58-85`
**Impact:** High - Causes incorrect caching behavior

## Performance Issues (Priority: Medium-High)

### Issue 4: Excessive Re-renders
**Title:** [PERF] Dashboard components cause excessive re-renders due to missing memoization
**Labels:** performance, dashboard, optimization
**Description:**
Heavy components like EnhancedMetricsCards are not memoized, and GSAP animations trigger on every state change.

**Location:** Multiple dashboard components
**Impact:** Medium - Poor performance on slower devices

### Issue 5: Memory Leaks in Animations
**Title:** [PERF] GSAP timelines and event listeners not properly cleaned up
**Labels:** performance, memory-leak, animations
**Description:**
GSAP timelines and event listeners in enhanced layout are not properly cleaned up, causing memory leaks.

**Location:** `app/(authenticated)/dashboard/_components/enhanced-layout.tsx`
**Impact:** Medium - Memory usage grows over time

### Issue 6: Bundle Size Optimization
**Title:** [PERF] Redundant animation libraries and unused imports increase bundle size
**Labels:** performance, bundle-size, optimization
**Description:**
Both GSAP and Framer Motion are imported (redundant), and unused Lucide icons are imported.

**Location:** Multiple files
**Impact:** Medium - Slower initial load times

## Code Quality Issues (Priority: Medium)

### Issue 7: Type Safety Improvements
**Title:** [TECH-DEBT] Mixed client/server patterns and missing types in dashboard
**Labels:** tech-debt, typescript, code-quality
**Description:**
Mixed client/server component patterns, `any` types in cache implementation, and missing error boundary types.

**Location:** Multiple files
**Impact:** Medium - Reduces code maintainability

### Issue 8: Error Handling Enhancement
**Title:** [ENHANCEMENT] Improve error handling with specific messages and retry mechanisms
**Labels:** enhancement, error-handling, ux
**Description:**
Generic error messages, no retry mechanisms for failed requests, and silent failures in components.

**Location:** Dashboard components
**Impact:** Medium - Poor error UX

## Enhancement Opportunities (Priority: Low-Medium)

### Issue 9: Accessibility Improvements
**Title:** [A11Y] Dashboard missing ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
**Labels:** accessibility, enhancement
**Description:**
Missing ARIA labels on interactive elements, no keyboard navigation for custom components, and loading states not announced to screen readers.

**Location:** Dashboard components
**Impact:** Medium - Excludes users with disabilities

### Issue 10: Mobile Responsiveness
**Title:** [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboard not optimized for mobile devices
**Labels:** enhancement, mobile, responsive
**Description:**
Dashboard layout and interactions not optimized for mobile devices and touch gestures.

**Location:** Dashboard components
**Impact:** Medium - Poor mobile UX
